# StockSim
A simple stock market simulator written in TypeScript.

## Features
- Simulates stock price fluctuations.
- Outputs stock prices at regular intervals.
- Configurable number of stocks and update intervals.

## Application Idea
StockSim emulates a lightweight electronic market where synthetic prices stream into observers, an automated strategy reacts with limit orders, and a portfolio component tracks fills and cash—providing a sandbox for experimenting with algorithmic trading concepts without real-market risk.
